Title: Contextually Adaptive Trilingual Voice Agent (CATVA)

Abstract:
A system and method for generating accent-neutral, context-preserving synthesized speech across multiple languages using a unified phoneme embedding space, a cross-lingual semantic graph, and an adaptive code-switching engine.

Inventors: [Your Name]
Assignee: [Your Entity]

Background:
(Explain multilingual COVID, code-switching issues, shortcomings of current TTS/ASR.)

Summary of invention:
(High-level recap of MCPE, CLSG, ACE, emotion persistence, voice identity preservation.)

Detailed description:
(Paragraphs describing mapping phonemes to unified vectors, training objectives, runtime pipeline, and examples.)

Claims (exemplary):
1. A method of converting an input utterance comprising mixed-lingual tokens into an accent-neutral synthesized output, comprising: converting each token to phoneme sequences; mapping each phoneme to a unified phoneme embedding space; constraining a voice identity model using the embeddings; generating a prosody vector to preserve emotion; and synthesizing audio.
2. A method of storing and preserving cross-lingual semantic context in a language-agnostic semantic graph.
3. A method for dynamically selecting response language(s) that optimizes user-preference, context preservation, and clarity using a policy network.
